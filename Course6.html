                <h2>Course Summary</h2>
                <p>Youth and students play a crucial role in addressing climate change and driving environmental action. As future leaders and decision-makers, young people have the power to influence attitudes, behaviors, and policies related to climate protection. Their energy, creativity, and openness to new ideas make them key contributors to climate awareness and innovation.</p>

                <p>Through education, community involvement, and advocacy, students can promote sustainable practices such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and supporting renewable resources. Many young people also participate in environmental campaigns, research projects, and climate movements, helping to spread awareness and demand action at local, national, and global levels.</p>

                <p>By actively engaging in climate action, youth and students help create a culture of responsibility and sustainability. Their involvement not only protects the environment today but also ensures a healthier and more resilient planet for future generations.</p>
